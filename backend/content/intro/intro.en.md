You can be proud of yourself: another Worm Cult camp lies destoryed. Almost two weeks have passed since the Stirk Fellowship seized the Writhing Fortress on Solstice. All across Tamriel the cult is retreating. Prince Azah sent you to hunt one of their generals.

Drinks-Your-Blood is a formidable necromancer. Rumor claims she forged a new kind of soul gem — one that can hold more than a single soul. If she fully charges it, she could reseal the breach in the Writhing Wall and undo the hard-won victories of the fellowship.

You must find Drinks-Your-Blood before it is too late! You hoped to corner her here, but she appears to have fled. At least she left some of her belongings behind.

You open the chest and gasp. Is that the great soul gem Drinks-Your-Blood has created? Carefully, you reach out and touch it.

Voices fill your head — many at once, all different, all with a shared goal.

> “Help us! The Worm Cult holds us captive. Help us! The cruel argonian bound us all into this soul gem. Help us! The longer we linger, the more we forget who we were. Help us! Learn who we were. Defeat Drinks-Your-Blood. Free our souls. Please, help us!”

The gem hums in your hands. You feel the magic within. Will you accept the challenge?

Note: Completing the story as a Veteran grants an extra reward. You may downgrade at any time, but downgrading forfeits the Veteran reward.

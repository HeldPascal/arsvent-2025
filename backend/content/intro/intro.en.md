You can be proud: another Worm Cult camp lies silent. Almost two weeks have passed since the Stirk cohort seized the Winding Bulwark on the solstice. Across Tamriel the cult retreats. Prince Azah sends you to hunt one of their generals.

Drinks-Your-Blood is a formidable necromancer. Rumor claims she forged a new kind of soul gem—one that can hold more than a single soul. If she fully charges it, she could reseal the breach in the Winding Wall and undo the hard-won victories of the cohort.

You must find Drinks-Your-Blood before it is too late. You hoped to corner her here, but she fled. At least she left belongings behind. Search them for clues.

You open a chest and gasp. Is that the great soul gem she crafted? Carefully, you reach out and touch it.

Voices fill your head—many at once, all different, all aligned.

> “Help us! The Worm Cult holds us captive. Help us! The cruel Argonian bound us all into this soul gem. Help us! The longer we linger, the more we forget who we were. Help us! Learn who we were. Defeat Drinks-Your-Blood. Free our souls. Please help!”

The gem hums in your hands. You feel the magic within. Will you accept the charge?

Note: Completing the story as a Veteran grants an extra reward. You may downgrade at any time, but downgrading forfeits the Veteran reward.

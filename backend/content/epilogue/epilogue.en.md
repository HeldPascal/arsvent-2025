Drinks-Your-Blood, the Worm Cult's general, has been defeated.
Not only that, but you have bound her to the very soul gem she herself created to torment others.
You feel the trapped souls rushing her life essence.
Before your eyes, the dreaded Drinks-Your-Blood dissolves into nothing but pure emptiness.
Without its creator, the soul gem can no longer hold any souls.
You feel the other souls one by one leaving the soul gem to finally begin their journey to Aetherius.
Thurwe Hrorikson, Ursalette Metrane, K’ren-Dar, Maleric Pontecus, Ciira Imutis, Enniz at-Hunding, Gin-Ei Xeirdes, Lytril Telvanni, Estile, Falemon, N’aabi, Erendas Dres, Logorok Mogdza, Hilthe Snowdaughter, Oraar Ugrud, Razaami, Itius Spurelus, Uralest Jeneve, Latharek, Magrub Grakish, Vilonia Woeus, and finally Telnidra.
At long last, you are alone for a moment.
And then you stand once more before the destoyed camp of the Worm Cult.
In your hands, you hold the soul gem.
It gleams clean and pure, no longer evil and dangerous.

You are not sure how much time has passed.
Was it 24 minutes, hours, or days?
However, you do know that Tamriel is a bit safer than it was before you embarked on this adventure.
Back to Prince Azah in Sunport, you give report about your adventure.
You report in detail about your search, the empty camp, the soul gem and the souls trapped therein.
Also, you report all details of your victory over Drinks-Your-Blood.

  Were we victorious?
  How did the battle go?

## Story
> My beloved siblings, my comrades.
  I remember all their faces.
  And my own, too.
  I was Uralest Jeneve.
  Each of us was a specialist in a field.
  My specialty was crafting equipment.
  Never go into battle without good gear!
  I was often rewarded for my skills.
  Take this.
  It is not one of my weapons or armor, but it is the next best thing.

You sense that more trapped souls are waiting for your aid.

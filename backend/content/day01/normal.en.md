# Cartographer Of The North

## Story
A magical wave washes over you. The soul gem pulls you inward. Everything feels dreamlike. You stand on a shore. The voices in your head grow louder and clearer. One steps forward and speaks:

> “I traveled the world and mapped what I saw. Was this the last place I visited? Where was I when death found me?”

## Puzzle
Which symbol marks this place on your map?

## Post
After making the correct choice, a relieved sigh echoes from the soul gem. The voices soften, and the memory of who Thurwe Hrorikson was flickers into focus for a heartbeat.

You sense more trapped souls waiting for your aid.

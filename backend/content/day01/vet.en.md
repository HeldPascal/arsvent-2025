A magical wave washes over you. The soul gem pulls you inward. Everything feels dreamlike. You stand on a shore. The voices in your head grow louder and clearer. One steps forward and speaks:

> “I traveled the world and mapped what I saw. Was this the last place I visited? Where was I when death found me?”

Which symbol marks this place on your map?

> “Yes, I remember. My name was Thurwe Hrorikson. This is Kyne’s Aegis, my home and my final trial. Thank you. Take this restoration staff. May it serve you better than it served me.”

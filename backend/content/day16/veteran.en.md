## Story
> This one didn't see any Divines, no.
  She was Razaami, a pilgrim.
  But when she reached Sunspire, the priests told her that the dragons were imposters!
  They were evil.
  So Razaami took her gift for the Divines back with her.
  Now you shall have it, five-claw, for this one believes in you.

You sense that more trapped souls are waiting for your aid.

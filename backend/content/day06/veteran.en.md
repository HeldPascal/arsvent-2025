## Story
You blink and instead of a map of the world, red banners hang on the walls.
They are similar, but not the same.

> Templar or Arcanist, Sorcerer or Nightblade… what am I?
  Am I even just one, or am I all of them?
  Who have I been?

## Story
> My memories, they are coming back!
  I was Enniz at-Hunding.
  My sister and I discovered a way to be more than the abilities you were born with.
  But no matter how different we are, we all live under the same stars.
  Take this as a reminder of that.

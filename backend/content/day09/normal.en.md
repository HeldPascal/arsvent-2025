## Story
You turn around, but the room you came from has turned into a treasure chamber.
Quickly, you enter.

  Something terrible happened, but we were saved.

## Wait for: trifecta

## Story
> My home was Cloudrest.
  Now I remember.
  And I remember my name, too.
  I was Estile and I loved collecting things more than anything.
  But in the end I learned that true beauty is not in gold, but in fleeting things.
  Take these plants as a reminder of what is truly precious.

You sense that more trapped souls are waiting for your aid.

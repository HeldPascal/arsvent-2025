# 15

## Story
You blink and where the Mundus Stones were standing just moments ago, there are now statues.
They are not carved from stone or wood, but are made entirely of glass and crystal.

> One fight, then another, over and over again.
  It was an infinite task.
  So many books, so much ink.
  Did I escape?
  I hunted her, in every form she took.
  Has she been destroyed?

## Wait for: archive

## Story
> The Infinite Archive.
  Tho'at Replicanum.
  Now I remember, she can never be truly defeated.
  But me?
  I was Oraar Ugrud, and I was able to leave the Archive.
  I returned to my brothers and sisters among the Undaunted.
  You are undaunted too, aren't you?
  Then take this key as a token of my trust in you.

You sense that more trapped souls are waiting for your aid.

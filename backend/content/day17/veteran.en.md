## Story
The temple model vanishes before your eyes.
It seems to have been standing on a sheet of paper.
This sheet contains a list of places you instinctively recognize as dangerous.

> I was always looking for a challenge.
  One, two, three.
  Challenges, lots of them.
  Did I find them?
  Did I lose them?
  Did I lose myself?

## Puzzle
id: "dlcs"
Which of these dungeons belong to the same dlc?

```yaml puzzle

```

## Wait for: dlcs

## Story
> Yes, I remember.
  I was Itium Spurelus.
  I sought out all these challenges, faced them, and mastered them.
  Just like challenges, I was always looking for new runestone combinations.
  Here, take this small collection I carried with me when I died.
  Find the combination that works best for you.

You sense that more trapped souls are waiting for your aid.
